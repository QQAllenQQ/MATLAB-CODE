%This function returns the total CP for MR processing scheme only,
%using the model defined Section 2, the parameters in Table 1 and the results 
% in Table 2

%
%INPUT:
%M                  = Number of BS antennas
%K                  = Number of UEs per cell
%B                  = Bandwidth
%tau_c              = Length of coherence block
%tau_p              = Length of pilot sequence
%ULfraction         = Fractions of UL and DL data - (tau_c - tau_p)/(tau_c) accounts for the
%                   remaining samples after pilot transmission
%valueset           = Select the value set of the power coefficients that is considered 
%                   (set valueset=2 to use the hardware parameters listen in Table 1 and 
%                   generate the results as in the article)
%ThroughputPerCell  = Uplink average ergodic Area Rate 
%
%OUTPUT:
%P_MR    = Vector of same size as Mrange with total CP for MR processing
